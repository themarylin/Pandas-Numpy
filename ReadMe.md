### Heroes of Pymoli

The following are interesting trends and notes regarding our player data:

* Of the total 573 players, 81.15% of the players are Male, and 17.44% are female. The other 1.41% are undisclosed or other. 

* The largest group of players reside in the 20-24 age group, making up 58.64% of the player demographics. 

* Our players do spend money, but with the average purchase price of less than $5.00, it is not a significant portion of the revenue.
